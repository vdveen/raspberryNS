# raspberryNS
An information screen using the NS API designed as a small Raspberry Pi web app.

Developed by vdveen. This local web app will fetch departure information from any NS station in the Netherlands and display it realtime in the browser. 

## Features:
* Responsive web app compatible with all screen resolutions. Designed for the 320x480 Adafruit 3,5" TFT screen.
* Displays up to ten train departures from any train station in the Netherlands
* Updates every minute, with a loading bar indicating the next refresh
* Displays departure time, departure platform, major calling stations and train type
* Displays delays, changed platforms and non-NS operators flexibly
* Can highlight trains that go to a specific destination
* Can 'skip over' trains that depart in the next X amount of minutes
* Official NS colors used

## Installation guide:
The app runs on NodeJS and two NPM packages. Some Raspberry Pi's might need node-semver as a dependancy for NodeJS. 

`$ npm install`

It also requires an API key. This can be obtained from https://www.ns.nl/ews-aanvraagformulier/. 

Copy the `.env-sample` file to `.env` en edit all configuration:

* Add your username and API key after the var username and var password. Make sure they are between quotation marks.
* [Optionally] Change the station that you want information to be displayed from. 
* [Optionally] Change the 'timedelta' variable. Setting this to 5 will make the information screen skip over all trains departing in the next 5 minutes.
* [Optionally] Change the highlighted station. A departing train is highlighted if its destination or route text contains the combination of letters defined here. 


How to run: basically, run this file in the terminal using node. CD to the correct folder:

`cd ~/[yourpath]/webapp`

Then, run the ns.js file in Node: `npm start`

Then, open any web browser and go to `127.0.0.1:3000`. Alternatively, you can run the command `chromium-browser --kiosk --new-window` to open the web app fullscreen. 

If you want to have the server run when starting your Raspberry Pi, you can append a line of code to your [rc.local file.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/rc-local.md)
